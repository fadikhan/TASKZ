# Task Management System - Final Year Project Proposal

## Project Overview
A modern web-based Task Management System built using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The system helps users organize and track tasks efficiently through a visual Kanban-style interface with a focus on user experience and productivity tracking.

## Project Objectives
1. Develop a responsive web application for task management
2. Implement core CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations
3. Create an intuitive user interface with status-based organization
4. Implement user authentication and profile management
5. Provide visual analytics and productivity tracking
6. Support both light and dark themes for better accessibility
7. Demonstrate proficiency in modern web development technologies
8. Apply software engineering best practices

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- **State Management**: React Context API and Hooks
- **UI Animation**: Framer Motion for smooth transitions
- **Data Visualization**: Chart.js for statistics
- **Icons**: Lucide React for consistent iconography
- **Date Handling**: date-fns for date manipulation
- **Notifications**: React Toastify for user feedback
- **Development Tools**: Vite, ESLint
- **Version Control**: Git

   - Delete tasks
   - Edit existing task details

3. **User Interface**
   - Kanban board layout
   - Responsive design for all screen sizes
   - Visual status indicators
   - Priority-based color coding
   - Dark/Light theme toggle
   - Animated transitions for better user experience

4. **Data Organization**
   - Status-based task categorization
   - Task filtering by status
   - Creation date tracking
   - Due date management

5. **Analytics and Tracking**
   - Visual dashboard with task statistics
   - Completion rate visualization
   - Session time tracking
   - Daily progress monitoring

## Technical Implementation
1. **Component Architecture**
   - Modular component design
   - Context providers for state management
   - Custom hooks for shared functionality
   - Separation of concerns between UI and logic

2. **State Management**
   - React Context API for global state
   - Local storage for data persistence
   - Optimized rendering with React hooks
   - Real-time updates across components

3. **Type Safety**
   - TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
   - Type checking for all operations
   - Improved code reliability and maintainability

4. **Responsive Design**
   - Mobile-first approach
   - Tailwind CSS for consistent styling
   - Adaptive layouts for different screen sizes
   - Accessible UI elements

## Development Phases
1. **Phase 1: Setup and Basic Implementation** (2 weeks)
